# Fish Tank

# The code that I made had some ups and downs, literally. I really enjoyed creating this coding structure and playing with some of the different colors and techniques I can do with the fish. I did my best to make it look like a fish bowl by adding bubbles and a background image of a fish bowl glass to make it look like its reflecting the background color. The container was a bit tricky because everytime I added a fish I had to say it was part of the container along with the other fish. Not only that but postitioning the fish were very complex as I had to play with the postive and negative numbers for the scale, angle, width, and height for each fish to try and get them where I want them to be. Overall, I tried my best to make it look good.
